This project provides a collection of tools for the BitTorrent protocol and especially the
[rTorrent client](https://github.com/rakshasa/rtorrent).
They enable you to filter rTorrent's item list for displaying or changing selected items,
also creating, inspecting and changing ``.torrent`` files, and much more.

An optional daemon process (``pyrotorque``) can add flexible queue management for rTorrent,
starting items added in bulk slowly over time according to customizable rules.
The same daemon can also watch one or more directory trees recursively for new metafiles using inotify,
resulting in instantaneous loading without any polling and no extra configuration for nested directories.

The `PyroScope` command line utilities are *not* the same as the sibling project
[rTorrent-PS](https://github.com/pyroscope/rtorrent-ps),
and they work perfectly fine without it;
the same is true the other way 'round.
It's just that both unsurprisingly have synergies if used together,
and some features *do* only work when both are present.

## Performing a Release

1. Check for and fix ``pylint`` violations:

        paver lint -m | egrep -v 'TODO|Too.many'

1. Verify ``debian/changelog`` for completeness and the correct version, and bump the release date:

        dch -r

1. Remove ‘dev’ version tagging from ``setup.cfg``, and perform a release check:

        sed -i -re 's/^(tag_[a-z ]+=)/##\1/' setup.cfg
        paver release

1. Commit and tag the release:

        git status  # check all is committed
        tag="v$(dpkg-parsechangelog | grep '^Version:' | awk '{print $2}')"
        git tag -a "$tag" -m "Release $tag"

1. Build the final release and upload it to PyPI:

        paver dist_clean sdist bdist_wheel
        twine upload dist/*.{zip,whl}

1. Create the ZIP file with the API documentation:

        paver autodocs
        # Make sure docs are built OK
        paver dist_docs

1. Upload the docs from the ``dist`` directory to ``pythonhosted.org``:

        xdg-open "https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=pkg_edit&name=pyrocore" &

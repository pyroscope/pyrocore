pyrocore (0.4.1) jaunty; urgency=high

  * Added bash completion for rtcontrol and rtxmlrpc, and generic option
    completion to the rest
  * rtcontrol: Removed short options from actions that are non-interactive
    by default, i.e. -S(top) and -C(lose); update your scripts accordingly
  * rtcontrol: "-s*" sorts according to the given output format
  * rtcontrol: "--stats" and "--summary" to print a statistical summary;
    note that for some fields (e.g. dates) and some kinds of formatting the
    summary values might not make sense
  * rtcontrol: Added "--detach", so you can call rtcontrol directly from
    rtorrent methods and event handlers
  * rtcontrol: Added "field=/regex/" pattern filter
  * rtcontrol: Added Tempita output templates, they have to start with
    '{{' to be recognized, use '{{#}}' if you don't start with a field;
    this allows "if" and "for" loops, for more on the syntax, see
    http://pythonpaste.org/tempita/
  * rtcontrol: Added "--output-template" to pass output control to a
    Tempita template.
  * rtcontrol: Output formats can now be file: URLs that get resolved
    automatically; paths can be absolute, relative to "templates" in the
    configuration directory or start with "~" for paths in the user's
    home. Note that the file content is stripped at the end (i.e. trailing
    spaces and newlines are removed).
  * chtor: "-s field" now deletes the field (assignment without any value)
  * chtor: "-no-ssl" forces announce URLs to be 'http'
  * mktor: the chtor "--set" option now also works with mktor
  * lstor: Added virtual "__size__" field
  * Bugfix: Conditions nested 2 or more levels didn't work
